Description

This repository houses implementations of both Genetic Algorithm and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithms. These algorithms are commonly used in optimization problems across various domains.
Purpose

The primary purpose of this repository is for learning and exploration of C++ programming. As such, please note that while the implementations are functional, there may be deficiencies and areas for improvement.

Disclaimer

  This project is primarily for educational purposes and is not intended for production use.
    Please be aware that the algorithms implemented here may not be optimized for performance or efficiency.
    Contributions to improve the code are welcome but are not actively encouraged as this project is not being actively maintained.

Getting Started

To explore the code:

  Clone the repository to your local machine.
  
  Navigate to the project directory.
  
  Compile and run the code using a C++ compiler.
  
  Feel free to experiment with the algorithms and modify the code as needed.
